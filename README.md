## Philosophy

- **Learning by building** - The best way to understand components is to create them
- **Practical implementation** - Every feature exists because I needed to figure out how to build it
- **Accessibility as education** - Learning to build inclusive components from the start
- **Personal growth** - Each component teaches me something new about React and design systems
- **Real-world application** - Built while learning, tested by using

Keep in mind: this is my journey of learning how to build components, so expect some experimentation and iteration along the way.
